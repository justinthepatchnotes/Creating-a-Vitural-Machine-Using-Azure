# Creating a Virtual Machine Using Azure


## Prerequisites and Installation

This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation steps for Creating a Virtual Machine Using Azure.

## Environments and Technologies Used
 **Azure Portal**
- **The Azure Portal is the main web interface for creating, configuring, and managing Azure VMs and other resources.** 
- **Usage: It offers a visual interface to select VM types, configure networking, assign storage, set up security, and manage monitoring options.**


## Operating Systems Used
-  **Azure VMs can run Windows Server for enterprise and web hosting, various Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and RHEL for open-source projects and development, while macOS can be used for connecting to and managing VMs using tools like Azure CLI and PowerShell.** 

## List of Prerequisites

- **Azure Account** 
- **Computer with Internet Connection**
- **Credit Card (Required for free Azure credits)**

## Installation Steps

    -  Follow the prompt to create the account 
    -  You will need to put in your credit card information, but you will get $200 worth of Azure credit and will have 30 days to use those credits. You will not be charged until then.

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Machine
1. Go to the Azure portal search bar at the middle top of the screen and search **Virtual Machine**.
2. Click Create Azure Virtual Machine at the middle bottom of the screen of the page.
3. We will need to select the same **Resource Group**, **Region**, and create a name for the virtual machine.
4. In this tutorial, we will name the virtual Machine **"Windows10ProVM"**.
5. We now need to select an Image for our virtual machine.
6. In this tutorial, we will be using a **Windows 10Pro VM image**.
6. Next scroll down to size , we need to select which VM size. 
6. Finally, we will create a username and password so we can login to our VM.
>9. Make sure to confirm and agree to licensing agreements .
10. Once validation is passed we have now successfully  created our VM.

### Step 5: Connect to the Virtual Machine
1. First we need to find the public IP Address of our virtual machine.
2. Select the virtual machine we created and copy the public IP Address on the right side of the Virtual Machine of the screen.
3. Open up Remote Desktop Connection or type **MSTSC** in our search bar. 
4. In Remote Desktop Connection we can then now paste in  our IP Address.
5. Enter username and connect. &nbsp;
